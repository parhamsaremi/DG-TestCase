Requirements:
------------

* If using macOS/Linux, follow [CI](.github/workflows/CI.yml) steps to install postgreSQL and run DB commands.
(NOTE: you may not be able to run the Frontend project yet on Linux.)

---

* If using Windows, install postgreSQL and after that, run
the DB commands from `.github/workflows/CI.yml`. You will be
able to compile the `backend.slnf` projects, but VisualStudio's
IntelliSense may not work in them.

(NOTE: Use VS2022 Preview to compile/run the Frontend project.)
